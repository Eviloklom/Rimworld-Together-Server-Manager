# Rimworld-Together-Server-Manager

## Introduction

This program is intended to be used as a "quality of life software" to speed up the process of manually configuring the json files generated by the "Rimworld Together" mod.

In the current version, the program shows all the information stored in said json and allows you to change it in a simple and direct way.

In the future I will add new features to the program that will allow greater management of server data and configurations.

NOTE: Some variables specific to the Rimworld Together mod appear with the description "Unknown". Feel free to provide me with the exact description of each variable so I can modify it. Additionally, you can manually modify the information in the csv files present in the csv folder yourself.

## How to Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Eviloklom/Rimworld-Together-Server-Manager/releases/tag/RTSM)
2. Unzip the rar contents on the "Rimworld Together" server folder
3. Run the program
