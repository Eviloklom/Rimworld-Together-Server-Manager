# Rimworld-Together-Server-Manager

## Introduction

This program is intended to be used as a "quality of life software" to speed up the process of manually configuring the json files generated by the "Rimworld Together" mod.

In the current version, the program shows all the information stored in said json and allows you to change it in a simple and direct way.

In the future I will add new features to the program that will allow greater management of server data and configurations.

NOTE: Some variables specific to the Rimworld Together mod appear with the description "Unknown". Feel free to provide me with the exact description of each variable so I can modify it. Additionally, you can manually modify the information in the csv files present in the csv folder yourself.

## How to Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Eviloklom/Rimworld-Together-Server-Manager/releases/tag/RTSM)
2. Unzip the rar contents on the "Rimworld Together" server folder
3. Run the program

The program is divided into tabs.

Currently only the "Core" tab is available. In the future, extra tabs will be implemented that will allow the management of information related to each directory.

Within the "Core" tab there is one tab for each json file. Each tab has a save button to save the data that has been modified in every specific tab. Each variable has a tooltip if you hover over the label. Note that variables mantain the same name as in the json file, and some do not exactly correspond to in-game names.

The program will always load the information stored in the json and csv files first, and will always show the last modification made.

## Final Notes
